# Fantasy Duck Sauce üîÆü¶ÜüçÖ

Download data from AFL Fantasy Draft and processes it with DuckDB.

I want to see the highest performing free agents that are playing this week so I can recruit them.

There's no way to filter by playing status in the new UI but we can pull all the data down and process it ourselves.

## Quick Start

```
LEAGUE=4465 COOKIE= sh run.sh
```
```
streamlit run app.py
```

Other Commands
```
duckdb database.duckdb
.read players.sql;
select * from players;
```
```
duckdb database.duckdb
.read playing.sql;
```
```
duckdb database.duckdb
.read returning.sql;
```
```
LEAGUE=4465 COOKIE= sh download.sh
```
```
npm install
npm run scrape
```
